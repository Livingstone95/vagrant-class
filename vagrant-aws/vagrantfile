# To use AWS as the provider in a Vagrantfile, you'll need to have the `vagrant-aws plugin`` installed. You can install it using:

# bash
# Copy code
# vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
# After installing the plugin, you can create a Vagrantfile with the AWS provider configuration. Below is a simple example Vagrantfile that you can use as a starting point. Replace the placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials and configuration:

# ruby
# Copy code

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "dummy"
  config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|
    # aws.access_key_id = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
    # aws.secret_access_key = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
    aws.keypair_name = "livingstone-eu-west-2"
    aws.region = "eu-west-2"  # Change to your desired AWS region
    aws.instance_type = "t2.micro"
    aws.ami = "ami-0e5f882be1900e43b"  # Specify the desired AMI ID
    override.ssh.username = "ubuntu"
    override.ssh.private_key_path = "C:\Users\USER\Documents\livingstone-eu-west-2.pem" #"path/to/your/private-key.pem"
  end
end


#Replace the placeholder values:

# YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY and YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY: Your AWS access and secret keys.
# YOUR_KEYPAIR_NAME: The name of your AWS key pair.
# us-east-1: The AWS region you want to use. Change it to your preferred region.
# t2.micro: The instance type. Change it based on your requirements.
# ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: The AMI ID. Specify the AMI you want to use for your instance.
# path/to/your/private-key.pem: The path to your private key file associated with the specified key pair.
# After configuring the Vagrantfile, you can use standard Vagrant commands like vagrant up, vagrant ssh, etc., to manage your AWS-based virtual machine.

# Remember to keep your AWS credentials and private key secure, and do not expose them in public repositories. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file for more secure handling of sensitive information.
